My programm is the answer to the exercise which was created by ChatGPT which is as follows:

## Inventory Management System ##

Create a system that manages an inventory of items in a store. The Item class should have properties like ID, Name, Quantity, and Price. You will need to implement the following features:
  •	Add items to the inventory
  •	Update item quantities (increase/decrease)
  •	Display all items in the inventory
  •	Find an item by its ID
  •	Calculate the total value of all items in the inventory.


I know there is a risk that my program might crash due to the various inputs maybe being null. I am currently working to make sure this doesn't happen (16 January 2025).
